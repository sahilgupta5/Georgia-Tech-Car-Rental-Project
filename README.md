As a team we had to analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an information system application to support a car rental system called Georgia Tech Car Rental (GTCR). We were required to use the Classical Methodology for Database Development. The system was implemented using a relational DBMS that supported standard SQL queries.
